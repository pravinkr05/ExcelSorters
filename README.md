# Open Elective Subject Allocation System - Excel sheet modifier website

## Introduction
During the open elective subject allocation at our institute, there were 1000 student records stored in an Excel sheet. Each student could select up to 10 subjects, with each subject having a maximum capacity of 60 students. The allocation process was based on the student's CGPA, starting with the student with the highest CGPA.

## Problem Statement
Allocating subjects manually for such a large number of students was time-consuming.

## Solution
To streamline this process, we developed a web-based application. 

## How it Works
This application allows users to upload the Excel sheet containing student data, select a column of CGPA sort the column by clicking the sort button, and then allows the user to select the preferred subjects for each student.<br/>
Once the selection is made, the user can submit the button and generate a new Excel sheet. This new sheet contains a new column indicating the allocated subject for each student. This process takes only a few seconds, making it much more efficient than manual allocation.

## Testing
We have tested the system with a subset of the data, checking for 300-400 students, and it has performed flawlessly.

## Current Usage
This system is currently being used at our institute, IIEST SHIBPUR, for open elective subject allocation, significantly reducing the time and effort required for this task.
